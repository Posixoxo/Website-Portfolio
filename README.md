üåü John Doe Portfolio | Clean & Responsive Web Designer Template


A modern, clean, and highly responsive Front-End Developer/Web Designer portfolio template. Built with a focus on readability, performance, and maintainability (cleaned for GitHub standards!).

This project uses semantic HTML5, modern CSS3 (with flexbox and grid layouts via media queries), and a small amount of native JavaScript for engaging scroll animations and project filtering.


‚ú® Key Features
Clean & Semantic Codebase: HTML, CSS, and JS files have been thoroughly cleaned, standardized, and commented for easy extension and customization.

Fully Responsive Design: Optimized for all screen sizes, from mobile (375px) to large desktop displays (1440px), utilizing CSS media queries.


Two Core Pages:

Homepage (index.html): Features a dynamic Hero section, an About Me component, a compelling "Gear/Setup" feature area with scroll animations (Intersection Observer), and a contact form.

Projects Page (project.html): A dedicated section for showcasing work with interactive category filtering using vanilla JavaScript.

Performance-Focused: Uses CSS keyframe animations (like the drop-in hero text) and native JS for smooth, non-library-dependent functionality.


üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
HTML5 (Semantic Structure)

CSS3 (Flexbox, Grid, Custom Properties, Responsive Media Queries)

JavaScript (Vanilla JS for Intersection Observer and Filtering Logic)
